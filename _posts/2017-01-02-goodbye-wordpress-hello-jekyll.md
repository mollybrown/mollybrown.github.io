It's now 2017! Yay! While it's internet-culture hip to complain that 2016 sucked
and we've all just barely survived, I beg to differ. Within the past six months
I've quit a job, started Turing, finally joined a women's cycling team,
completed the Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree Program, and joined the
board of a local non-profit. Suffice to say I am both short on time and excited
about all that I am learning. However, there is still one thing that seemed to
perpetually escape my ability to Get Shit Done - my personal website.

Back in my days of working as a freelance photographer, I bought the domain name
[mollyrachelbrown.com](http://mollyrachelbrown.com) to showcase my photography
portfolio. I slapped a nice masonry Wordpress theme on top, uploaded some photos,
and called it done. It did the job, but I could never quite escape the feeling that Wordpress
was rather heavy-handed for what I was trying to do. As my focus shifted away from
photography and towards software development, the purpose of my personal site became
confused yet I was unwilling to give up my domain. I procrastinated on what to do with it
for an embarrasingly long time.

Not anymore! Armed with my newly-acquired skills in Ruby and the ability to piece
together a respectable front-end, I've decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
(a static site generator), [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
(a lightweight responsive CSS grid system), and some domain name tweaking to ditch
Wordpress and create my own site pointing to my old custom domain.
